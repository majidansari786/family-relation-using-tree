# 🌳 Family Relation Using Tree

A C-based project that models and manages family relationships using a **tree data structure**.  
Each person is represented as a node, and parent–child connections form the hierarchical family structure.

---

## 📘 1. Introduction

The **Family Relation Using Tree** project demonstrates how hierarchical structures can be used to represent family relationships efficiently.  
Each node corresponds to a family member, and edges represent parent–child relationships.

The project implements:

- Adding new family members  
- Finding parents, children, and siblings  
- Determining relationships  
- Tree traversal techniques (Preorder & Level Order)

This helps understand recursion, dynamic memory allocation, and real-world hierarchical modeling.

## 🎯 2. Objectives

- Implement a tree-based structure to represent family relations  
- Understand hierarchical data structures  
- Apply tree traversal algorithms  
- Develop logic for determining relationships  
- Provide a menu-driven interface for interaction and testing  

---

## 🧩 3. Problem Statement

Family relationships can be complex and interconnected.  
The goal is to design a system capable of:

- Adding new family members under specific parents  
- Displaying parent, children, and sibling information  
- Determining relationships between two members  
- Traversing the family tree efficiently  

All implemented using **C structures, pointers, and algorithms**.

## ⚙️ 4. Methodology / Approach

### **1. Data Representation**
Each member is a **node** containing:
- Name  
- Pointer to parent  
- Pointers to children  

### **2. Tree Construction**
- The oldest ancestor is the **root node**  
- New members are linked dynamically under their parents  

### **3. Operations Implemented**
- Add a new member  
- Find parent, children, siblings  
- Determine relationships  
- Preorder traversal  
- Level-order traversal  

### **4. Algorithms Used**
- Tree traversal (DFS, BFS)  
- Parent-pointer ancestor lookup  
- Recursive search algorithms

## 👍 7. Advantages

- Offers clear understanding of tree-based hierarchy modeling  
- Easy to extend for larger genealogies  
- Efficient querying using parent pointer lookup  
- Enhances knowledge of pointers and dynamic memory in C  

---

## ⚠️ 8. Limitations

- Suitable only for simple family structures (no complex marriages)  
- Requires unique names for each node  
- Data is not saved permanently (no file storage implemented)
